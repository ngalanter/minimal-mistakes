  <p> I am a Ph.D. candidate in the University of Washington <a href = "https://www.biostat.washington.edu/">Department of Biostatistics</a>, advised by <a href = "http://faculty.washington.edu/mcarone/about.html">Marco Carone, Ph.D.</a>, and  <a href = "http://www.alexluedtke.com/">Alex Luedtke, Ph.D.</a>. I also work with <a href = "https://www.kpwashingtonresearch.org/our-research/our-scientists/shortreed-susan-m">Susan Shortreed, Ph.D.</a> on methods for variable selection for optimal treatment rules using marginal structural models. </p>

  <p> My research interests include causal inference, analysis of EHR data, and semi and non parametric methods. I am particularly motivated by applications in mental/behavioral health care and in health systems. My research is supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. </p>
    
<p> Before beginning my Ph.D., I graduated with a B.A. in Mathematics from <a href= "https://www.grinnell.edu/">Grinnell College</a> and spent a year as an <a href = "https://americorps.gov/">Americorps VISTA</a> volunteer. </p>
