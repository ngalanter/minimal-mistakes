  <p> I am a third year Ph.D. student in the University of Washington <a href = "https://www.biostat.washington.edu/">Department of Biostatistics</a>. My research interests include causal inference, analysis of EHR data, and semi and non parametric methods. I am particularly motivated by applications in mental/behavioral health care, health systems, and the social sciences. </p>

  <p> I am researching methods for optimal treatment rules with Marco Carone, Ph.D., and  Alex Luedtke, Ph.D.. I also work with Susan Shortreed, Ph.D. on methods for variable selection for optimal treatment rules using marginal structural models. My research is supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. </p>
    
<p> Before beginning my Ph.D., I graduated with a B.A. in Mathematics from <a href= "https://www.grinnell.edu/">Grinnell College</a> and spent a year as an Americorps VISTA volunteer. </p>
