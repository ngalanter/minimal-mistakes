  <p> I am a third year Ph.D. student in the University of Washington Department of Biostatistics. My research interests include causal inference, analysis of EHR data, and semi and non parametric methods. I am particularly motivated by applications in mental/behavioral health care, health systems, and the social sciences. 

  <br> I am researching methods for optimal treatment rules with Marco Carone, Ph.D., and  Alex Luedtke, Ph.D.. I also work with Susan Shortreed, Ph.D. on methods for variable selection for optimal treatment rules using marginal structural models. My research is supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. 
    
<br> Before beginning my Ph.D., I graduated with a B.A. in Mathematics from Grinnell College and spent a year as an Americorps VISTA volunteer.
